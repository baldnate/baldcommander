This is baldnate's automation app for wrangling stuff he needs to wrangle during streaming.  At the moment, these include:

- muting and un-muting his mic (including a visual reminder of when it is muted)
- controlling his SWP123 A/V switch
- changing scenes in OBS

## Future Improvements

- Adding the rest of my OBS workflow to this, as it would let me further shrink the OBS window while I am streaming
- Cross fading between background music and game music (for raffles and BRB scenes)
- Volume levels would be awesome, as that would let me minimize Voice Meeter Banana during streams
- Switching Amarec modes (240p to 480i)
- Anything else I find in my streaming workflow that isn't wholly integrated
