# baldcommander

This is baldnate's automation app for wrangling stuff he needs to wrangle during streaming.  At the moment, these include:

- muting and un-muting his mic (including a visual reminder of when it is muted)
- controlling his A/V signal pathway (SWP123, DVS 304 DVI, component matrix switch, RT2X)
- changing scenes in OBS, including transition selection

## Future Improvements

- Adding more of my OBS workflow to this
  - Media control for my baldnate theatre segments
  - More automation for intro and outro
  - More consoles
  - Better PC game support
- More indicators (stream stats, VU meters, connection status to my local instruments, etc.)
